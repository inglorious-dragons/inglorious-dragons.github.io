Hello Everyone and welcome to a Kingdom of Ashes here on Inglorious Dragons

If you love table top roleplaying games then  come and see how we play dungeons and dragons on www.titch.tv/inglorious_dragons where we stream live every Friday at 21:00 GMT until late.

We are just a group of like minded friends who love to create epic D&D stories and have an ongoing D&D campaign.
